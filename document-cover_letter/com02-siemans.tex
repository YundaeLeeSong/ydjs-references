I am Jaehoon Song, a GT student (GTC alumni) in computer science with strong interest in software engineering 
opportunities at Siemens. 
I met Mr. Mehic at the Siemens booth during the GTC career fair on October 21, 2025 
and he suggested that I apply and offered to forward my resume to the appropriate division. 
Upon his recommendation, I have attached my resume for your review.

I have 4+ years of professional experience as a full-stack developer, working across 
front-end and back-end systems. My background includes desktop, web, and mobile 
development, as well as systems work such as Linux customization and automation scripting.

While supporting SK Battery America through SK C\&C in 2021, I have been exposed 
to industrial systems, networking components, and PLC-related workflows. 
That experience helped me appreciate the importance of reliable software in 
manufacturing and industrial settings, and I believe it gives me relevant context 
for contributing to Siemens.

I learn new domains and tools quickly and take responsibility for the roles 
I accept. I am flexible and eager to contribute my software engineering 
skills wherever they are most useful—whether on front-end, back-end, mobile, 
systems, or other software teams.

It would be a pleasure to discuss how my experience and motivation can 
help your team. I will be available for full-time work after my graduation in December 2025.

Thank you for your consideration.
