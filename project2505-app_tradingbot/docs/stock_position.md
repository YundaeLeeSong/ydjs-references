## How to Read Each Column

| Column               | Meaning                                                                                  |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Asset**            | The ticker symbol of the stock you hold.                                                 |
| **Price**            | The current market price per share.                                                      |
| **Qty**              | The number of shares you own (“Long” means you bought them; “Short” would mean you sold borrowed shares). |
| **Side**             | “Long” = you own the shares; “Short” = you owe shares you’ve borrowed and sold.          |
| **Market Value**     | Current total value = Price × Qty.                                                       |
| **Avg Entry**        | Your average purchase price per share.                                                   |
| **Cost Basis**       | What you paid in total = Avg Entry × Qty.                                                 |
| **Today’s P/L (%)**  | (Price – The **previous** trading-day’s closing price) ÷ previous close, for today’s move. |
| **Today’s P/L ($)**  | Today’s profit or loss in dollars = (Price – previous close) × Qty.                       |
| **Total P/L (%)**    | (Price – Avg Entry) ÷ Avg Entry across the life of the trade.                             |
| **Total P/L ($)**    | Your all-time profit or loss in dollars = (Price – Avg Entry) × Qty.                       |

   - Use stop-loss and take-profit orders to manage risk.
