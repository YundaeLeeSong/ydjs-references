# High Yield Cash & PDT Regulations on Alpaca

## üö´ Message Explanation

> **"Your account is no longer eligible for the High Yield Cash program due to PDT regulations."**

This message means your account has been **disqualified from earning interest** (High Yield Cash program) because it has been flagged under **Pattern Day Trader (PDT) regulations**.

---

## üß† What is PDT (Pattern Day Trader)?

Under **FINRA rules**, a Pattern Day Trader is someone who:
- Makes **4 or more day trades within 5 business days**
- In a **margin account**
- When those trades are more than **6% of total trades** in that same period.

To **legally continue day trading**, you must maintain at least **$25,000 in your account**.

## üíµ What is the High Yield Cash Program?

This program pays you interest on uninvested cash. However:
- It is typically only available for **non-margin accounts** (i.e., **cash accounts**)
- Or margin accounts **not flagged as PDT**

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Become Eligible Again

### Option 1: Switch to a Cash Account
- Cash accounts are not subject to PDT rules.
- You won‚Äôt be able to use leverage or trade unsettled funds, but you‚Äôll qualify for High Yield Cash.
- You can request to change your account type by contacting Alpaca support or checking your **account settings** in the Alpaca dashboard.

### Option 2: Stop Pattern Day Trading
- If you‚Äôve triggered PDT status recently, avoid day trading for a while.
- PDT flag may reset after a certain period (usually **90 days**).
- You can contact Alpaca to **request a reset or downgrade** of your margin account.

### Option 3: Maintain $25,000 Balance
- If you want to keep margin and day trade, keeping your equity above $25,000 satisfies PDT rules.
- This won't necessarily reinstate High Yield Cash eligibility, though‚ÄîAlpaca often reserves that **only for non-day-trader accounts**.
