# Alpaca FDIC Bank Sweep Program - Plain English Summary

## 1. What Happens to Your Extra Cash?

* Any uninvested dollars in your Alpaca brokerage account get automatically “swept” into bank deposit accounts that earn interest.

## 2. Which Banks?

* Alpaca has a list of FDIC‑insured banks (you can see it online).
* Your money is divided among those banks so each slice stays under the \$250K FDIC insurance limit (or \$500K if it’s a joint account).

## 3. FDIC Insurance Rules

* **You’re covered up to \$250K per person, per bank.**
* If you have accounts elsewhere at the same bank, those balances get added together for insurance.
* If your sweep balance goes over \$1M (or \$2M joint), extra cash still sweeps but isn’t insured.

## 4. Interest Rates & When You Get Paid

* **Rate:** It’s a variable rate (right now around 4.07% APY).
* **How It’s Calculated:** They look at your average daily swept balance each month.
* **When You See It:** Interest compounds daily and lands in your account on the last business day of each month.

## 5. Fees That Affect Your Rate

* Banks pay Alpaca a fee to be in the program; that fee lowers your net rate.
* If the bank’s rate is too low to cover Alpaca’s fee, you might pay a small “shortfall” fee (up to 0.50%).

## 6. How Money Moves In & Out

* **In:** As soon as cash hits your brokerage account (sales proceeds, dividends, deposits), it sweeps—unless it posts after 2 PM ET, in which case it waits until the next business day.
* **Out:** When you buy a stock, write a check, or request a withdrawal, Alpaca pulls from those deposit accounts automatically.

## 7. Your Action Items

* **Check your total deposits at each bank** (if you also hold direct accounts or CDs elsewhere) so you don’t exceed FDIC insurance limits.
* **Opt out** of any bank you don’t want to use—but beware that may reduce how much of your money is insured.
* **Review rates online** anytime (they can change daily): [https://alpaca.markets/disclosures](https://alpaca.markets/disclosures)

## 8. Tax & Statements

* You’ll get one Alpaca statement each month showing: beginning balance, ending balance, deposits/withdrawals, and interest earned.
* Interest shows up on your 1099‑INT and is taxed as ordinary income.
