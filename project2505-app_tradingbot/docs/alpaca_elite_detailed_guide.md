## 1. What Is the Elite Smart Router?

The **Elite Smart Router** is Alpaca’s institutional-grade, algorithmic order router that intelligently directs your buy/sell orders across multiple venues to seek the best execution price.

### 1.1 Why “Smart”?

- **Dark & Non-Displayed Liquidity**  
  - Before hitting the public order book, the router checks private venues (“dark pools”) where large institutional orders trade anonymously.  
  - Trading in dark pools can reduce market impact and slippage by keeping your intentions hidden.  

- **Speed & Efficiency**  
  - Routes orders in milliseconds across exchanges, Alternative Trading Systems (ATSs), and dark pools.  
  - Aims to minimize the spread between the displayed best bid and best ask prices.
