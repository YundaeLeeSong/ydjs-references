# Commission-Free Options Trading: A Plain Explanation

This is a simple, jargon-free guide to understand options on Alpaca.

---

## What Is an Option?
An **option** is a contract giving you the **right** (but not the obligation) to buy or sell a stock at a fixed price before a certain date.

- **Call Option**: Right to **buy** the stock at the strike price.
- **Put Option**: Right to **sell** the stock at the strike price.

Think of it like reserving the right to buy concert tickets at $50 even if the price later rises to $100.

---

## Why “Commission-Free” Matters
Alpaca waives its own per-contract fee. You only pay small mandatory fees charged by exchanges (about $0.01 per contract).

- **Old cost**: $0.50 broker fee + $0.01 exchange = $0.51 per contract.
- **Now**: $0.01 exchange fee only.

## How to Trade Options on Alpaca

1. **Apply and Get Approved**  
   - Click **Start Application** on the banner.
   - Fill in a short form about your experience.
   - Wait 1–2 business days for approval.

2. **Place an Option Order**  
   Use the same submit_order call, adding `asset_class='options'`, `strike`, and `expiry`.

   ```python
   api.submit_order(
       symbol='AAPL',
       qty=1,
       side='buy',               # buy a call or put
       type='limit',
       asset_class='options',
       strike=150,               # the fixed price
       expiry='2025-06-20',      # expiration date
       time_in_force='day',
       limit_price=2.50          # premium per share, total cost = 2.50 x 100
   )
   ```

3. **Monitor and Close**  
   - If the option gains value, submit a `sell` order to take profit.
   - If it expires out of the money, it simply expires and you lose the premium paid.

---

## Key Points to Remember

- **Premium**: Cost you pay, quoted per share; multiply by 100 for total.
- **1 Contract = 100 Shares**.
- **Call** bets on price **up**; **Put** bets on price **down**.
- **Risk** when buying = premium paid (cannot lose more).

---

## Why Use Options?

- **Leverage**: Control more shares with less capital.
- **Limited Risk**: Buying options caps your maximum loss at the premium.
- **Flexibility**: Speculate on up or down moves, hedge existing positions, or build multi-leg strategies.

# Why `asset_class='options'` Matters in Alpaca API

When placing orders with Alpaca, you need to tell the API **what** you’re trading:

---

## 1. Asset Classes in Alpaca
- **Equity (Stocks/ETFs)**: Regular shares you buy or sell.
- **Options**: Call or put contracts on shares, with additional parameters.

---

## 2. Purpose of `asset_class='options'`
- **Identifies the Order Type**  
  Switches Alpaca’s API to options mode, enabling option-specific fields.
- **Enables Validation**  
  Accepts `strike` and `expiry` parameters; rejects them for equity orders.
- **Routes to Correct Endpoints**  
  Uses the options order endpoint instead of equities.
- **Formats Responses**  
  Returns fills, positions, and P/L in option-contract terms (100 shares per contract).

---

## 3. Key Differences

| Property         | Stock Order (Default)                       | Option Order                                   |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| `asset_class`    | *omitted* (defaults to `"us_equity"`)       | `"options"`                                    |
| Required Fields  | `symbol`, `qty`, `side`, `type`, `time_in_force`  | + `strike`, `expiry`                            |
| Interpretation   | Buy/Sell shares of the underlying stock     | Buy/Sell call or put contracts (100-share lots) |

---

## 4. Example Comparison

```python
# Stock Order (Equity)
api.submit_order(
    symbol='AAPL',
    qty=1,
    side='buy',
    type='limit',
    limit_price=150,
    time_in_force='day'
)

# Option Order
api.submit_order(
    symbol='AAPL',            
    qty=1,                    
    side='buy',               
    type='limit',
    limit_price=2.50,         # premium per share (×100 shares)
    time_in_force='gtc',
    asset_class='options',    # ← tells Alpaca: “this is an option”
    strike=150,               
    expiry='2025-06-20'       
)
```

---

## 5. Bottom Line
`asset_class='options'` is the **switch** that activates all option-related behavior in Alpaca’s trading API. Without it, any option-specific order will be treated (and rejected) as a normal stock order.

# Do You Need Options?

If you primarily enjoy trading and analyzing stocks, you **do not** need to trade options. Options are an advanced toolset that introduce extra complexity and are **optional**, not mandatory, for engaging with the market.

---

## Key Points

- **Equities Are Sufficient**  
  Trading shares gives you access to all core market dynamics—price movements, trends, volume analysis, and reactions to news—without additional layers.

- **Options Introduce Complexity**  
  Options bring in:
  - **Expiration Dates** and **Strike Prices**  
  - **Time Decay (θ)**  
  - **Implied Volatility** and other **Greeks**  
  - Nonlinear payoff structures

- **Requirements & Costs**  
  - **Approval**: Must apply and get approved for options trading.  
  - **Margin Account**: Usually a minimum equity requirement (e.g., $2,000).  
  - **Fees**: Even commission-free, you still pay exchange and regulatory fees per contract.

---

## Conclusion

Options are **not** required to fully experience and profit from the stock market. If you prefer simplicity and focus on share price action, stick with equities. Consider options later if you want defined-risk strategies, leverage, or hedging capabilities.
