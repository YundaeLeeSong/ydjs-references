2. **Compile application materials**: transcripts, statement of purpose (SOP), résumé/CV, three recommendation letters, test scores (optional GRE, required TOEFL/IELTS if applicable), and the fee or waiver request.  
3. **Personalize** every component—use your high GPA to demonstrate academic excellence, highlight proof‐based math courses, and show how your CS background gives you an edge in computational and applied mathematics.  
4. **Follow the timeline**—submit by December 15, 2024, for Fall 2025, request transcripts and ask referees early.  
5. **Polish** your SOP and recommendations by leveraging best practices from Purdue’s OWL, UW, and UA guidance.  

Below is a fully integrated checklist and narrative.

## 1. Eligibility & Prerequisites

- **Bachelor’s degree**: You must hold (or complete by enrollment) a four-year bachelor’s in mathematics or a related discipline that includes at least one year of advanced study beyond calculus and introductory linear algebra.  
- **Advanced coursework**: GT expects proof-based courses (real analysis, abstract algebra) plus exposure to at least three areas (e.g., topology, differential equations, probability, numerical analysis).  
- **GPA context**: While GT’s Graduate Studies Office does not list a strict minimum for the M.S. in Math, most admitted master’s applicants at Tech hold GPAs ≥ 3.0, and BS/MS dual-degree applicants need ≥ 3.3. Your 3.87 GPA in CS is well above these norms.

## 4. Funding & Fee Waivers

- **MS funding**: Rarely provided by the Math School (PhD students are funded; MS are not).  
- **Fee waivers**: Institute-level waivers available; if denied, request School-level waiver.  
- **BS/MS dual-degree**: If you remain at GT, apply internally after 30 GT credits with GPA ≥ 3.3 (no fee).  

---

## 5. Personalization: Leveraging Your 3.87 CS GPA & Background

- **Academic excellence**: Emphasize your 3.87 major GPA as proof of mastery in a rigorous STEM discipline; it positions you well above typical thresholds.  
- **Proof-maturity**: List and briefly describe your 3000-/4000-level math courses (real analysis, algebra, etc.) under “Relevant Coursework” to show you’ve done proof-based work.  
- **CS → Math synergy**: Highlight projects where you applied algorithms, simulations, or computational methods to math problems—this interdisciplinary strength is prized in applied and computational math.  
- **Faculty fit**: Research 1–2 GT math faculty whose work excites you (e.g., in computational algebra or mathematical modeling) and mention them in your SOP to demonstrate genuine match.  

---

## 6. Statement of Purpose (SOP) Best Practices

- **One unifying narrative**: Fuse your CS achievements and math interests around a central theme (e.g., “computational methods in topology”).  
- **Program-specific customization**: Write a distinct SOP for GT; reference GT’s courses, seminars, and faculty.  
- **Structure**:  
    1. **Hook**: A mathematical problem or project that inspired you.  
    2. **Background**: Key CS/math experiences, proof courses, research.  
    3. **Fit**: Why GT? Which faculty, labs, or student groups?  
    4. **Goals**: Post-M.S. plans (industry, Ph.D., teaching).  
- **Length & format**: 1–2 pages (≈500–1,000 words), 12 pt serif font, 1–1.5 line spacing, clear headings.  

---

## 7. Letters of Recommendation

- **Select recommenders** who know you well in advanced math or CS courses (earned A’s) and can attest to your proof-maturity and research potential.  
- **Provide materials**: CV, transcript, SOP draft, bullet points on your interactions and achievements—in person or via email.  
- **Guidance**: Ask if they can comment on your readiness for graduate-level math, teamwork, and communication skills; these narrative details outweigh test scores.  
- **Timeline**: Ask ≥ 2 weeks before deadline; send polite reminders one week prior; follow up with thank-you notes.
