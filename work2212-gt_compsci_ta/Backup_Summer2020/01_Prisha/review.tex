    % Question #1
    %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    \item[1.]
    We defined the union and intersection of two sets. These definitions can be naturally extended for finitely many sets, recursively adding one new set. (maybe give an example with union of three sets here or something) The union and intersection of $n$ sets is denoted by $\bigcup_{i = 1}^{n} A_{i}$ and $\bigcap_{i = 1}^{n} A_{i}$, respectively.
    For each collection below, find $$\bigcup_{i = 1}^{n} A_{i} \qquad \bigcap_{i = 1}^{n} A_{i}$$
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item for $A_{i} = \{1, 2, \dots i\}$, where $i \in \mathbb{N}$.
        \item for $A_{i} = \{\dots, -1, 0, 1, 2 \dots, i\}$, where $i \in \mathbb{N}$.
        \item some other set here
    \end{enumerate}

            \item $(X \cup Y) \cup Z$
            \item $(X \cup Y) \cap (X \cup Z)$

    % Question #7
    %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    \item[7.]
    Let the Universe be the set of all Georgia Tech students. Let $T$ be the set of all students who are TAs, let $S$ be the set of all students who are seniors, and let $C$ be the set of all students. Translate the following statements only using the sets given and set operations
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item The set of all TAs who are not seniors
            \item The set of all students who are a part of a club or are seniors and not both
            \item The set of all seniors who are TAs and are not a part of a club
            \item The set of students in a club who are also TAs but have over a year before they graduate.
