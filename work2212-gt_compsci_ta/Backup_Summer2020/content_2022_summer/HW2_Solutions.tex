    \item Consider the following predicates on the variable $x$, where $x \in \{\text{beings}\}.$
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item[i.] $A(x):$ $x$ is an algorithm.
        \item[ii.] $B(x):$ $x$ is a Brontosaurus.
        \item[iii.] $C(x):$ $x$ is conscious.

    Rewrite each the following English sentences using only mathematical quantifiers. Next, negate the statement (ensuring that all negations appear beside predicates and not quantifiers) and translate it back into English. \pte 8

    Invoke DeMorgan's law for quantifiers and double negation twice to yield a RHS of $\forall x P(x) \lor \forall y P(y)$. Cite the variable domains and bounds to declare $y$ as an instance of $x$, which makes these statemements logically equivalent.
