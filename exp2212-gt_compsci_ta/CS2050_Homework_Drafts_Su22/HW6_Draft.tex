This assignment is due on \textbf{11:59 PM EST, Wednesday, July 13, 2022}.  On-time submissions receive 3\% extra credit. You may turn it in one day late for 5\% penalty or two days late for a 15\% penalty. Assignments more than two days late will NOT be accepted.  We will prioritize on-time submissions when grading before an exam. \\ 

You should submit a typeset or \emph{neatly} written pdf on Gradescope.  The grading TA should not have to struggle to read what you've written; if your handwriting is hard to decipher, you will be required to typeset your future assignments.\\ 

You may collaborate with other students, but any written work should be your own. Write the names of the students you work with on the top of your assignment.\\

Always justify your work, even if the problem doesn't specify it. It can help the TA's to give you partial credit.
