\begin{enumerate}
    \item If you run fast enough, you will start to fly. You did not start to fly. Therefore, you did not run fast enough.
    \item Most reptiles can talk, but only some fish can talk. Therefore, most reptiles can talk.
    \item I will have soup. I will have salad. Therefore, I will have soup and salad.
    \item You are either a freshman, a sophomore, a junior, or a senior. You are not a freshman or a junior or a senior. Therefore, you are a sophomore.

\item Using the rules of inference, show that the following premises conclude with “Yoshi wins the race, and Luigi rides a bike.” Be sure to define all propositional variables for full credit (for example, you may define “$t$: Toad gets lost” as one of your propositional variables). Remember, it is possible that you will use all premises, but it is also possible that some are not needed. \pt{12}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item[1.] Toad gets lost, and Luigi rides a bike.
    \item[2.] If Luigi does not ride a bike, then Wario cheats.
    \item[3.] Rosalina is the best princess in the race.
    \item[4.] Wario does not cheat, or Toad does not get lost.
    \item[5.] If Wario does not cheat and Toad gets lost, then Yoshi wins the race.
