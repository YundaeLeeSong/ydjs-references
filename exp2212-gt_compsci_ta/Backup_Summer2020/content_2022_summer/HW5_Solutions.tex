\begin{solution}
\begin{tabular}{c|c}
    Statement & Reason \\
    \hline
    $a|c$ & Assumption \\
    $b|d$ & Assumption \\
    $c=ax, x \in \mathbb{Z}$ & Definition of divides \\
    $d=by, y \in \mathbb{Z}$ & Definition of divides \\
    $cd=(ax)(by)$ & Multiplication \\
    $cd=(ab)(xy)$ & Associative law \\
    $z = xy$ & Def. new variable \\
    $z \in \mathbb{Z}$ & Closure of $\mathbb{Z}$ under multiplication and addition \\
    $cd = (ab)(z)$ & Substitution \\
    $ab|cd$ & Definition of divides\\
\end{tabular}
Thus, we have shown using direct proof that if $a|c$ and $b|d$, then $ab|cd$. \square
