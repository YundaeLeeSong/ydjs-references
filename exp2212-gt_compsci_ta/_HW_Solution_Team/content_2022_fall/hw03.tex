    \begin{solution}
    \\
    \\ a) Proof: I proceed with a proof by contrapositive. I will prove that if $n$ is odd then $n^3 + 12$ is odd.

    1) $n = 2k + 1$ for some $k \in \mathbf{Z}$ & definition of odd\\
    2) $n^3 = (2k+1)^3$ & cube both sides of (1)\\
    3) $n^3 = 8k^3 + 12k^2 + 6k + 1$ & expand (2)\\
    4) $n^3 + 12 = 8k^3 + 12k^2 + 6k + 13$ & add 12 to both sides\\
    5) $n^3 = 2(4k^3 + 6k^2 + 3k + 6) + 1$ & factor out 2 from RHS\\
    6) $t = 4k^3 + 6k^2 + 3k + 6 t \in \mathbf{Z}$ & Closure of multiplication and addition of \mathbf{Z} \\

    3) $n^3 + 12 = 8k^3 + 12k^2 + 6k + 13$ & expand (2)\\
    4) $n^3 + 12 = 2(4k^3 + 6k^2 + 3k + 6) + 1$ & factor out 2 from RHS\\

    7) $n^3 + 12$ is odd & Definition of odd\\

    This contradicts the statement that is $n^3 + 12$ is even, thenn $n$ is odd. Therefore by proof by contradiction, I have shown that if $n^3 + 12$ is even, then n is even. This completes the proof. QED

    \item Given an integer x such that $x^3 - x$ is odd, prove that the x-th term of the Fibonacci sequence is odd.
    \item Prove that if $x$ is a positive integer such that $1/log(x) = \sqrt[3]{ln(x)}$, then $x^3 +x > x$.
    \end{enumerate}
    %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Solution %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    \begin{solution}
    
    a) Proof: I proceed using a vacuous proof. I will prove that given an integer $x$ the number $x^3 - x$ will not be odd.
    
    Let $x$ be an arbitrary integer. There are two cases to consider: $x$ can be even or odd.

    Case 1: $x$ is even.
    
    \begin{tabular}{l|l}
    Statement & Reasoning \\ \hline
    1) $x$ is even & assumed for Case 1\\
    2) $x = 2k$ for some $k \in \mathbf{Z}$ & definition of even\\
    3) $x^3 = (2k)^3$ & raise both sides of (2) to the third power\\
    4) $x^3 - x = (2k)^3 - x$ & subtract x from both sides\\
    5) $x^3 - x = (2k)^3 - 2k$ & substitute (2) into (4)\\
    6) $x^3 - x = 8k^3 - 2k$ & apply exponent\\
    7) $x^3 - x = 2(4k^3 - k)$ & factor 2 from right-hand side of (6)\\
    8) $4k^3 - k = z$ for some $z \in \mathbf{Z}$ & closure of integer multiplication and addition\\
    9) $x^3 - x = 2z$ & substitution of (8) into (7)\\
    10) $x^3 - x$ is even & definition of even
    \end{tabular}
    
    Case 2: $x$ is odd.
    
    \begin{tabular}{l|l}
    Statement & Reasoning \\ \hline
    1) $x$ is even & assumed for Case 1\\
    2) $x = 2k + 1$ for some $k \in \mathbf{Z}$ & definition of odd\\
    3) $x^3 = (2k + 1)^3$ & raise both sides of (2) to the third power\\
    4) $x^3 - x = (2k + 1)^3 - x$ & subtract x from both sides\\
    5) $x^3 - x = (2k + 1)^3 - (2k + 1)$ & substitute (2) into (4)\\
    6) $x^3 - x = (8k^3 + 12k^2 + 6k + 1) - (2k + 1)$ & distributive property\\
    7) $x^3 - x = 8k^3 + 12k^2 + 4k$ & algebra\\
    8) $x^3 - x = 2(4k^3 + 6k^2 + 2k)$ & factor 2 from right-hand side of (7)\\
    9) $4k^3 + 6k^2 + 2k = z$ for some $z \in \mathbf{Z}$ & closure of integer multiplication and addition\\
    10) $x^3 - x = 2z$ & substitution of (9) into (8)\\
    11) $x^3 - x$ is even & definition of even
    \end{tabular}
    
    I have shown that for every integer $x$, $x^3 - x$ is even and therefore not odd. Therefore by vacuous proof, the conditional "if $x$ is an integer such that $x^3 - x$ is odd, then the $x$-th term of the Fibonacci sequence is odd" is always true because the hypothesis is always false. This completes the proof. QED
    
    b) Proof: I proceed using a trivial proof. I will prove that for any positive integer $x$, $x^3 + x > x$ is true.
    
    \begin{tabular}{l|l}
    Statement & Reasoning \\ \hline
    1) $x > 0$ & definition of positive\\
    2) $x^3 > 0^3$ & raise both sides to the third power\\
    3) $x^3 + x > x$ & add $x$ to both sides\\
    \end{tabular}
    
    I have shown that for every positive integer $x$ it is true that $x^3 + x > x$. Therefore by trivial proof, the conditional "if $x$ is a positive integer such that $\frac{1}{log(x)} = \sqrt[3]{ln(x)}$, then $x^3 + x > x$" is always true because the conclusion is always true. This completes the proof. QED
