    % Question #6
    %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    \item[6.]
    List all the elements of $\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P}(\emptyset))) - \mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P}(\emptyset)) + \mathcal{P}(\emptyset) - \emptyset$
    %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Solution %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    \begin{solutiondraft}
        By definition, the power set of $S$ is the set of all subsets of the set $S$. Thus, the only element of a power set of an empty set will be an empty set itself.
        $$\mathcal{P}(\emptyset) = \{\emptyset\}$$
        Now, we do have an element that is an empty set which means we do not have an empty set for $\mathcal{P}(\emptyset)$. Using the definition of power set again, we can derive the followings.
        $$\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P}(\emptyset)) = \{\{\emptyset\},\emptyset\}$$
        $$\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P}(\emptyset))) = \{
            \{\{\emptyset\},\emptyset\},
            \{\{\emptyset\}\},
            \{\emptyset\},
            \emptyset
        \}$$
        $$\textbf{Answer: }\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P}(\emptyset))) - \mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P}(\emptyset)) + \mathcal{P}(\emptyset) - \emptyset = \{
            \{\{\emptyset\},\emptyset\},
            \{\{\emptyset\}\},
            \emptyset
        \}$$
