I'm in a software development project building an application for medical system, what possible Minimum Marketable Features (MMFs) are there?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

can you give me a list of user stories by features requirements with "requirements In Scope", "Stretch Goals", and "Future Goals"? (include all the alternatives and error conditions that can occur) 



The corresponding MMF (Minimum Marketable Feature) is as follows.
Login with Authentication: a login system satisfying the following purposes
	1. Date of Birth, Full Name, and Medical Record Number (MRN) retrived from another subsystem (epic) for authentication, to eliminate the need for additional account setup steps.
	2. Custom Login (using our own id/password) just in case of being not able to retrive data from another subsystem (epic)

can you make it a little shorter? but not too short with moderate level of vocab


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Now, I want you to extract out all requirements about the application. Here is a project description.

Here is an example of user story and its scenario.


Story: As a caregiver, I want to add visual information for tasks so that the patient can understand the task even if they canâ€™t read.

Scenario 1: The caregiver wants to add an image that describes the action for a task.
Given that the caregiver is on the task configuration page;
When they upload an image of their choice for the task;
Then the image will be associated with the task and will be seen by the patient.
Scenario 2: The caregiver wants to change the image that describes the action for a task.
Given that the caregiver is on the task configuration page;
When they click edit image on a task and upload a different image of their choice;
Then the old image for the task will be replaced by the new image and the new image will be seen by the patient.
Scenario 3: The caregiver wants to delete an image associated with a task.
Given that the caregiver is on the task configuration page;
When they click the edit button on a task and press the delete image button over the image; Then the image will be removed from the task and the patient will no longer see any image with the task.




Here my user story. "As a patient, I want to be able to log in using my Date of Birth, Full Name, and Medical Record Number (MRN) retrieved from the epic system so that I can access my medical records and information conveniently."
